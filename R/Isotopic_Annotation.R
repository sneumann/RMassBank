#' Checks for isotopes in a \code{msmsWorkspace}
#' 
#' @param w A \code{msmsWorkspace} to work with.
#' @param mode \code{"pH", "pNa", "pM", "pNH4", "mH", "mM", "mFA"} for different ions 
#' 			([M+H]+, [M+Na]+, [M]+, [M+NH4]+, [M-H]-, [M]-, [M+FA]-).
#' @param intensity_cutoff The cutoff (as an absolute intensity value) under which isotopic peaks shouldn't be checked for or accepted as valid.
#'        Please note: The cutoff is not hard in the sense that it interacts with the intensity_precision parameter.
#' @param intensity_precision The difference that is accepted between the calculated and observed intensity of a possible isotopic peak. Further details down below.
#' @param conflict Either "isotopic"(Peak formulas are always chosen if they fit the requirements for an isotopic peak)
#' 		  or "strict"(Peaks are only marked as isotopic when there hasn't been a formula assigned before.)
#' @param isolationWindow Half of the width of the isolation window in Da 
#' @param evalMode Currently no function yet, but planned. Currently must be "complete"
#' @param plotSpectrum A boolean specifiying whether the spectrumshould be plotted
#' @param settings Options to be used for processing. Defaults to the options loaded via
#' 			\code{\link{loadRmbSettings}} et al. Refer to there for specific settings.
#' @details text describing parameter inputs in more detail.
#' \itemize{
#'  \item{\code{intensity_precision}}{This parameter determines how strict the intensity values should adhere to the calculated intensity in relation to the parent peak.
#'  Options for this parameter are \code{"none"}, where the intensity is irrelevant, \code{"low"}, which has an error margin of 70\% and \code{"high"}, where the error margin 
#'  is set to 35\%. The recommended setting is \code{"low"}, but can be changed to adjust to the intensity precision of the mass spectrometer.}
#  \item{\code{evalMode}}{This parameter sets what should be done after the isotopic check. The option "add" adds failpeaks if they are isotopic peaks of previously matched peaks.
#  "check" checks matched peaks with formulas for isotopes and removes them if no isotopic peaks have been found for all formulas. The formula is also
#  adjusted, if the one with matching isotopes doesn't have the lowest dppm. "complete" does both.}
