\title{Export internally stored MassBank data to files}
\usage{
exportMassbank(compiled, files, molfile)
}
\arguments{
\item{compiled}{\code{RmbSpectraSet}
the spectra of one compound for which files should be exported}

\item{molfile}{A molfile from \code{\link{createMolfile}}}
}
\value{
No return value.
}
\description{
Exports MassBank recfile data arrays and corresponding molfiles to physical
files on hard disk, for one compound.
}
\details{
The data from \code{compiled} is still used here, because it contains the
"visible" accession number. In the plain-text format contained in
\code{files}, the accession number is not "accessible" anymore since it's in
the file.
}
\note{
An improvement would be to write the accession numbers into
\code{names(compiled)} and later into \code{names(files)} so \code{compiled}
wouldn't be needed here anymore. (The compound ID would have to go into
\code{names(molfile)}, since it is also retrieved from \code{compiled}.)
