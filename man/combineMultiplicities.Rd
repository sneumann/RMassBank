\title{Combine workspaces for multiplicity filtering}
\usage{
  combineMultiplicities(workspaces)
}
\arguments{
  \item{workspaces}{A vector of \code{msmsWorkspace} items.
  The first item is taken as the "authoritative" workspace,
  i.e. the one which will be used for the record
  generation. The subsequent workspaces will only be used
  for multiplicity filtering.}
}
\value{
  A \code{msmsWorkspace} object prepared for step 8
  processing.
}
\description{
  Combines multiple msmsWorkspace items to one workspace
  which is used for multiplicity filtering.
}
\details{
  This feature is particularily meant to be used in
  conjunction with the \code{confirmMode} option of
  \code{\link{msmsWorkflow}}: a file can be analyzed with
  \code{confirmMode = 0} (default) and subsequently with
  \code{confirmMode = 1} (take second highest scan). The
  second analysis should contain "the same" spectra as the
  first one (but less intense) and can be used to confirm
  the peaks in the first spectra.

  TO DO: Enable the combination of workspaces for combining
  e.g. multiple energy settings measured separately.
